# What is Baseless.bingo?
Baseless.bingo is a website companion to the podcast Baseless Speculation where 3 of Australia's worst minds attempt to anticipate the world of popular cinema. With no research and even less common sense the BS boys tell you what a Marvel or a DC or an other big franchise will do with their next big release. This site gives you a big juicy bingo sheet to hold those boys accountable, and randomised so you can compete with your friends. So far there are 0 confirmed bingos.

# How can I help?
If you know how to use git and GitHub or want to learn and need a basic project you can add sheets via [GitHub]({{ site.github }}). There is a guide on how in the projects wiki.

If you're not a nerd but still want to help the site is enabled with Brave rewards. So any user of the Brave web browser (which you should be using already) can send me their sweet sweet ad money. Just switch over to the Brave browser, enable Brave rewards, and send me those BATs!
